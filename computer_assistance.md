I do small, on-the-side computer repair and configuration projects, such as

- configuring home networks,
- wireless printer setup,
- transitioning to new computers,
- tutorials for computer usage,
- other miscellanous projects.

If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch with me.</a> Whatever you need, I can help you out!

For anything more mission-critical, I recommend [Progressive Tech](http://progressivetech.com/){:target="_blank"}. They have excellent, friendly service and a great reputation in the Seattle area.
