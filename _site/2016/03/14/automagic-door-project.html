    <h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I’m living in a dorm! But unfortunately, sometimes my keys get forgotten (through no fault of my own, obviously). They seem to jump right out of my pocket before I leave the room. So I devised a solution.</p>

<p>Back in October, I purchased a Raspberry Pi, a bunch of mini servos, and 25 ft of Ethernet cable. I first attempted to use a continuous servo to activate the handle of my dorm room’s door, with limited success. The servo did not have nearly enough torque to consistently pull down the handle. So I bought a stepper motor, 3D printed a mount for it, and attempted to open the door that way. But it still lacked torque. At this point, school began to get harder (and I had mostly stopped forgetting my keys) so I abandoned the project.</p>

<h4 id="new-developments">New Developments</h4>
<p>However! A few weeks ago, I was poking around and came across the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/accessories/Motorola-Keylink/keylink.html">Motorola Keylink</a>. It was on clearance, so naturally I picked up 2 of them. As it turns out, they’re nearly useless as phone finders when paired with an iPhone; they don’t even work when the app isn’t active. However, they are essentially little Bluetooth pagers – you send them a signal from a phone, and they beep. It seemed to me that one would work perfectly for relaying a signal to open a door. Furthermore, it would allow me to avoid the significant headache of connecting the system to the University’s local network, and running a secure web server on the Raspberry Pi for activating the door. Taking an entire device out of the mix promised to simplify the project significantly. So I started back at it again, this time planning to only use the stepper, connected to the Keylink and an Arduino. <em>I’m aware that Bluetooth is probably not completely secure, but the Keylink will not offer to pair with new devices if it’s already paired to one, so I figure it’s reasonably secure, at least through obscurity.</em></p>

<h4 id="gears----how-do-they-work">Gears – how do they work??</h4>
<p>At the same time, I’m trying to learn how to use <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion 360</a> for CAD, which is a huge step up from the designs that I’d previously been making in SketchUp. However, there’s also somewhat of a learning curve, and I’m currently stuck on how to make gears (why are they so complicated?).</p>

<em>The current state of the motor mount</em></p>

<p>As soon as I can figure out how gears work, we’ll be off to the races! I’m hoping to do so within the next two weeks, since I’ll be on break from University.</p>
