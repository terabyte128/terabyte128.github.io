A list, in no particular order, of cool things that I've seen around the web.

- [Ingraham Robotics](http://ingrahamrobotics.org/){:target='_blank'} - my high school's robotics team.
- [Milesian Media](http://milesianmedia.net/){:target="_blank"} - my friend's website, with cool games, programmer-y stuff and other interesting media. You should probably check it out, I hear he's a pretty cool guy.
- [FRC Scout](https://frcscout.com){:target="_blank"} - in case you're into *super* niche things, this is a web app that I helped to develop for scouting robots in the 2015 First Robotics Competition season. If none of that rings a bell,
you can learn more [here](/projects). 
- [My Electric Go Kart](http://myelectricgokart.com){:target="_blank"} - I converted a go-kart to run off electricity a while ago, and, while I'm too big to fit on it now, it was a great project and kept me occupied throughout most of middle school.
