A list, in no particular order, of cool things that I've seen around the web.

- [Milesian Media](http://milesianmedia.net/){:target="_blank"} - my friend's website, with cool games, programmer-y stuff and other interesting media. You should probably check it out, I hear he's a pretty cool guy.
- [My Electric Go Kart](http://myelectricgokart.com){:target="_blank"} - I converted a go-kart to run off electricity a while ago, and, while I'm too big to fit on it now (and I can drive real cars!), it was a great project and kept me occupied throughout most of middle school.
