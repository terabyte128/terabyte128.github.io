        Welcome to my website. On this site, you may find interesting things about me, my various projects, and what I like to do in my spare time.
        I've got older projects archived in the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page, and I'll be <a href="/blog/">blogging</a> about current and ongoing projects as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also offer various <a href="/freelance_work/">freelance work</a> related to small-scale computer and technology projects, including website and application development.
