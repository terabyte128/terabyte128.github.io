<h4><a href="http://dawgs.run" target="_blank">Husky Running Club</a></h4>
I have been running regularly with the Husky Running Club since my freshman year of college. This year, I was elected the role of Technology Coordinator. I help to manage the technology resources of the club, including our website. I also serve as a run leader, showing new members our routes and ensuring that nobody gets lost.

I also enjoy skiing ⛷, hiking 🌲, camping 🏕, playing guitar 🎸 (mainly acoustic), and writing <a href="https://github.com/terabyte128/braintrust-bot" target="_blank">silly programs</a> for my friends and I to use in our chat groups.
