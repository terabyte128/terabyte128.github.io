#### [Sourdough Breadmaking](http://breadcrumbs.samwolfson.com)
I studied abroad in Rome in autumn 2018, and got really into baking sourdough bread. I even [wrote a blog about it!](http://breadcrumbs.samwolfson.com) I love the "magic" of the yeast in the starter creating gas bubbles in the gluten that allow the bread to rise and become soft and airy. The whole process is a crazy coincidence of trapping the byproducts of a couple microorganisms into a material that just so happens to have the right amount of elasticity to flex while still being strong enough not to break.

I have been running regularly with the Husky Running Club since my freshman year of college. For the past two years, I have also served as our Technology Coordinator. I help to manage the technology resources of the club, including our website. I also serve as a run leader, showing new members our routes and ensuring that nobody gets lost.

I also enjoy skiing ⛷, hiking 🌲, camping 🏕, playing guitar 🎸 (mainly acoustic), and writing <a href="https://github.com/terabyte128/braintrust-bot-rails" target="_blank">silly programs</a> for my friends and I to use in our chat groups.
