Welcome to my new website! I've completely redone it using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Recently, I've been playing around with Python and the web framework Django. I've used it mainly with creating a scouting app for my school's FRC robotics team ([FRC Scout](http://frcscout.com/)). This app allows us to record other data on teams in matches to see how well they do. We've open-sourced it and promoted it to other teams, giving them free access to enter and access all the data in the database. 


If I can remember, I might update this blog periodically with new things that I'm up to. We'll see.
